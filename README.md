In this repo i will be posting whatever i will do in sem 4 in dbms at nit sxr

every folder structure is :
- schema.sql → Contains CREATE DATABASE, USE, and all CREATE TABLE statements with constraints, indexes, and relationships.
- queries.sql → Contains practice queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, joins, etc.).
- notes.md → Optional Markdown file where I jot down explanations, observations, or tricky points you learned in that lab.
